# What is it?
A web-based platform where students submit solutions to coding problems for instructors to grade. Instructors create class sessions and receive unique session ID's. Students then join classes with this ID to access the IDE where the code will be submitted. Instructors can view all the students in their class and review/grade their work. 

# How does it work?
The app requires Node.js to be installed. Following the Quick Start guide below will get the app up and running on your lcoal machine.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

# Who made it?
Four UCI computer science students who believe that the existing classroom coding methodologies are outdated can be improved.

# Why we made it?
To challenge ourselves and see if we can build a product that students and instructors would enjoy using.
